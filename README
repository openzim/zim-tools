zimwriterfs is a console tool to create ZIM (http://www.openzim.org)
files from a localy stored directory containing a "self-sufficient"
HTML content (with pictures, javascript, stylesheets). The result will
contain all the files of the local directory compressed and merged in
the ZIM file. Nothing more, nothing less. The generated file can be
open with a ZIM reader, Kiwix (http://www.kiwix.org) for example, but
you have other one (http://openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_Readers).

zimwriterfs works for now only on POSIX compatible systems, you simply
need to compile it and run it. The software does not need a lot of
resources, but if you create a pretty big ZIM files, then it could
take a wile to complete.

GNU/Linux compilation
---------------------

To compile zimwriterfs, you need the GNU compiler with the GNU
autotools suite. You also need to have a few dependencies (dev
version) installed on the system:

* liblzma (http://tukaani.org/xz/, most of the time packaged),
  resp. for the LZMA comp.
* libzim (http://openzim.org/download/, probably not packaged),
  resp. for the ZIM compilation
* libmagic (http://www.darwinsys.com/file/, most of the time
  packaged), resp. for the mimeType detection
* libz (http://www.zlib.net/), resp. for unpack compressed HTML files

./autogen.sh
./configure
make

OSX compilation
----------------

On MaxOSX, a script helps you build zimwriterfs both statically and dynamically.
You must have a working and set up Kiwix repository (with dependencies ready).

1. Install libmagic with brew (it's important)
	- ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	- brew install libmagic
2. KIWIX_ROOT=/Users/xxx/src/kiwix ./macosx-build.sh
