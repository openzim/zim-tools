ZIM tools
=============

Various ZIM command line tools. More information about the ZIM format
and the [openZIM project](https://openzim.org).

Most famous tools are:

* `zimcheck` verifies that a given [ZIM](https://openzim.org) file is
  not corrupted. It provides many features to secure that ZIM entries
  are proper and properly linked.

* `zimdump` inspects or dumps (part of) a [ZIM](https://openzim.org) file.

* `zimsplit` splits
  [smartly](https://wiki.openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_file_format#Split_ZIM_archives_in_chunks)
  a ZIM file in smaller chunks.

* `zimwriterfs` creates [ZIM](https://openzim.org) files from a
  locally-stored directory containing "self-sufficient" HTML content
  (with pictures, javascript and stylesheets). The result will contain
  all the files of the local directory compressed and merged in the
  ZIM file. Nothing more, nothing less. The generated file can be
  opened with a ZIM reader; [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org) is one example,
  but there are [others](https://openzim.org/wiki/ZIM_Readers).

* `zimfuse` creates a filesystem FUSE module that enables access to 
  the content of a [ZIM](https://openzim.org) file, allowing users to 
  view entries as files.

A few other tools are provided as well but are of less value for most
of the usages.

Disclaimer
----------

This document assumes you have a little knowledge about software
compilation. If you experience difficulties with the dependencies or
with the ZIM libary compilation itself, we recommend to have a look to
[kiwix-build](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-build).

Dependencies
------------

* [ZIM](https://openzim.org) (package `libzim-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
* [docopt.cpp](https://github.com/docopt/docopt.cpp) (package `libdocopt-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
* [Mustache](https://github.com/kainjow/Mustache) (package `libkainjow-mustache-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
  Be sure you use Mustache version 4.1 or above. You can just copy the header `mustache.hpp`
  somewhere it can be found by the compiler and/or set CPPFLAGS with correct `-I` option.

`zimwriterfs` relies on many third-party software libraries. They are
prerequisites to compiling zimwriterfs. The following libraries
need to be available:

* [Magic](https://www.darwinsys.com/file/) (package  `libmagic-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
* [Z](https://zlib.net/) (package `zlib1g-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
* [Gumbo](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) (package `libgumbo-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)
* [ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) (package `libicu-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu)

`zimfuse` relies on [FUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) (package `fuse3` on Debian/Ubuntu)

These dependencies may or may not be packaged by your operating
system. They may also be packaged but only in an older version. The
compilation script will tell you if one of them is missing or too old.
In the worst case, you will have to download and compile a more recent
version by hand.

If you want to install these dependencies locally, then ensure that
meson (through `pkgconf` or `pkg-config`) will properly find them.

Environment
-------------

The ZIM tools build using [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) version
0.43 or higher. Meson relies itself on Ninja, Pkgconf and few other
compilation tools.

Install first the few common compilation tools:
* Meson
* Ninja
* Pkgconf or Pkg-config

These tools should be packaged if you use a cutting edge operating
system. If not, have a look to the [Troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting)
section.

Compilation
-----------

Once all dependencies are installed, you can compile ZIM tools with:
```bash
meson . build
ninja -C build
```

By default, it will compile dynamic linked libraries. All binary files
will be created in the "build" directory created automatically by
Meson. If you want statically linked libraries, you can add
`-Dstatic-linkage=true` option to the Meson command.

Depending of you system, `ninja` may be called `ninja-build`.

Testing
-------

To run the automated tests:
```bash
cd build
meson test
```

To compile and run the tests, [Google
Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) is requested (package
`googletest` on Ubuntu).

Installation
------------

If you want to install the ZIM tools you just have compiled on your
system, here we go:
```bash
ninja -C build install
```

You might need to run the command as root (or using 'sudo'), depending
where you want to install the libraries. After the installation
succeeded, you may need to run ldconfig (as root).

Uninstallation
--------------

If you want to uninstall the ZIM tools:
```bash
ninja -C build uninstall
```

Like for the installation, you might need to run the command as user
`root` (or using `sudo`).

Container
---------

A container image with `zimwriterfs`, `zimcheck`, `zimdump` and all the
other tools can be built from the `docker` directory. The project
maintains an official image available at https://ghcr.io/openzim/zim-tools.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you need to install Meson "manually":
```bash
virtualenv -p python3 ./ # Create virtualenv
source bin/activate      # Activate the virtualenv
pip3 install meson       # Install Meson
hash -r                  # Refresh bash paths
```

If you need to install Ninja "manually":
```bash
git clone git://github.com/ninja-build/ninja.git
cd ninja
git checkout release
./configure.py --bootstrap
mkdir ../bin
cp ninja ../bin
cd ..
```

If the compilation still fails, you might need to get a more recent
version of a dependency than the one packaged by your Linux
distribution. Try then with a source tarball distributed by the
problematic upstream project or even directly from the source code
repository.

### Magic File

`zimwriterfs` use libmagic to detect the mimetype of files to add.
It needs to load the magic database. Most of the time, this file is already present
in your system and everything works.
But sometime, this file may be not present or cannot be found.
You can set the `MAGIC` environment variable to point to this file.

`zimwriterfs` will refuse to run if this file is not found. You can force
it to run passing the option `--skip-libmagic-check`.
